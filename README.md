Introduction

In this project, we will be building a small informational website containing a list of 30 "top places to see" in San Diego, which we will refer to as "Top Spots".
To accomplish this, we will need to:
Include CSS styling provided by Bootstrap
Create a container component to manage application state.
Create a presentational component to render a single top spot.
Render a collection of Top Spots in the container component.
